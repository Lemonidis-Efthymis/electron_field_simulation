# Electron Motion in a Uniform Electric Field

A Python simulation of an **electron moving in a uniform electric field**.

The script:
- Calculates the electron trajectory using classical mechanics
- Plots the motion between parallel plates
- Shows positive and negative plates
- Prints the final vertical displacement

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/electron_field_simulation.git
   cd electron_field_simulation
